# metaverse

A platform to easily engage advertising/marketing networks with virtual assets in the meta world.

### Imagine

Imagine you could view a sub meta world space in which you can place your ads in. For this example I'm using games but you can realize this concept to any virtual world that people would participate in actively or passively.

First option would be to choose your world you'd like to place your ad content in and let's say you know certain major events will happenn in the future.  Under campaigns you can see the list of events.

For each campaign you get to see the virtual world for which your ad content will be present:

1. Billboard content
2. Virtual interactable content via 3d mesh
3. Sound bite content interaction with world and user

All 3 items above could potentially be their own subdivision/company. #1 could involve deep fake suite of tools allowing quick and easy placement of real life people(tom cruise) into virtual billboard ads without them even having to step out the door. #2 Content tools to aide in simplification of mesh design onto 3d objects. 3# again utilizing ai this could take a list of sounds/words and build a complete library of a person's voice(arnold schwarzenegger)

After you have decided which segment of space you want your ad content to be present you can bid on that particular space.

### Result

What would this be if you couldn't actual see this in a virtual world. Let me demonstrate loading this dynamic ad content that has been bidded on and is now the winning content to display:  To make this more relevant I've placed an ad you'll recognize.
